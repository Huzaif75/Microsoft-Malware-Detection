# Microsoft-Malware-Detection
The enormous volumes of data and files that need to be assessed for potential harmful intent are one of the biggest issues anti-malware now encounters.
The objective was to successfully categorize/predict and analyze such a vast number of files in order to identify any dangerous content and files that belonged to a certain malicious family.
Features like Bi-gram and pixel intensities were taken in account by using feature engineering approaches.
Machine learning models were developed using XGBoost and Random forest algorithms with measures like log loss being taken into consideration as a metric.
Out of the models mentioned above, this work's log loss was decreased to the extent, measuring less than 0.02 and having about 91% of labels properly identified.
